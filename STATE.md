# STATE.md — Keyrun

**Intent (Matt, 2026-09-18):** "isolating m+ from WoW and just making it an open and queue game like Dark and Darker,
and let people manage their characters from a simple screen... study other mmos, dungeon games, gear progression, and
find specifically what people find exciting/fun, build talent trees, classes, the dungeon POC with initial enemies,
abilities, a boss. Mechanics like interrupts, but be more creative than blizzard devs... 4-5 rotational abilities per
class max, 10 total keybinds should be plenty for rotation, movement, utility... the goal is class synergy." No art
assets; pure POC.

## Locked decisions
- D1 **Stack**: TypeScript for sim, content, client, bots, server; Vitest; esbuild; Three.js for the 3D client; no engine.
- D2 **Bots-first**: the first playable is one human plus bot party against the dungeon; networking is phase 4.
- D3 **3D MVP** (Matt, 2026-09-18: "2d is not playable, please 3d mvp"): third-person camera, WASD + mouse-look,
  placeholder geometry only. The sim stays headless and deterministic; 3D is the renderer plus a flat-arena
  movement model (no navmesh in the POC). Readability of mechanics beats everything.
- D4 **Constraints as design**: ≤5 rotational abilities, ≤10 keybinds, synergy-first classes.
- D5 **Research before design**: no class, talent, gear, or boss mechanic enters the bible without a cited
  precedent for WHY it is fun — but the precedent is the reason, never the design.
- D6 **Original, not a copy** (Matt, 2026-09-18: "it does not need to be a copy of any of the big games, use your
  creative reasoning"): the bible must invent Keyrun's own classes, synergy system, mechanics vocabulary and loop.
  Fellowship (Chief Rebel, 2025) is the closest precedent — reviewed well while admittedly half-baked — and is studied
  specifically for the gap between what it promised and what it shipped.

- D7 **Bounded progression** (Matt, 2026-09-18: "there is an ending to progression, a technical bis that is hard to
  achieve... because otherwise characters scale infinitely and break the game"): power has a cap; best-in-slot is
  reachable but hard; post-cap progression is cosmetic, prestige, and new keys — never more stats. Progression is
  the most important system in the bible.

- D8 **North star** (Matt, 2026-09-18): "m+ at its core is extremely fun, but it lives in a game where every class is
  gutted, way too easy, and it is just boring right now. I miss being able to log in during late DF to early TWW and
  get into high keys instantly and play with people who were chill." Three tests every design decision must pass:
  (1) classes with real depth and keys that are genuinely hard; (2) from launch to a high key in under a minute,
  no gatekeeping; (3) the social defaults make strangers chill — mercy, backfill, no score-shaming.
- D9 **Tick rate — DECIDED 2026-09-18 (orchestrator, unattended; research/11):** stay at 20 Hz. Measured on the
  playable (65 s/arm, same seed): 30 Hz cut input→tick p95 from 51 ms to 34 ms but cost +43% CPU, +50% bytes/s,
  +31% render stalls, and content is authored in raw ticks so the flip alone runs the game 1.5x fast. Reverses if:
  a real Web Worker removes the scheduler-shaped stalls AND content constants are rescaled in lockstep AND the
  latency gain still shows in play tests.

- D10 **MVP = 3D gameplay** (Matt, 2026-10-17: "I would like to restate the mvp on that is 3d gameplay"): the
  MVP deliverable is one complete 3D run Matt can play end to end and judge by feel, not a test count. Concretely:
  third-person camera + WASD + mouse-look that feel right in hand; one dungeon (hollow-vault) with readable enemies,
  the interrupt mechanic, and the boss; one class (warden) plus bot party; placeholder geometry stays, but readability
  of every mechanic in 3D is the bar. D3 still governs the renderer/sim split (headless deterministic sim, 3D is the
  renderer + flat-arena movement). Phase 5 "Matt playing" is the acceptance test. Supersedes nothing; sharpens D3.
- D11 **Model grant for Keyrun** (Matt, 2026-10-17: "use opus 5.5 for development on that"): development lanes for
  this project run on Opus (claude-opus-5-5). Per-project exception to the fleet Haiku-default rule; recorded in
  ~/.claude/docs/grants.md with provenance. Does not relax the Haiku rule for any other project. Read-only recon,
  lint and bookkeeping lanes stay Haiku.

## Phase plan
- Phase 1 (research day): 9 cited briefs (incl. Fellowship) → design/BIBLE.md v1 (Matt reviews the taste calls).
- Phase 2: sim/ rules engine (deterministic, tested) + content v1 (3 classes, 1 dungeon, 1 boss).
- Phase 3: bots/ + client/ (Three.js) → playable in a browser tab, one human + bots.
- Phase 4: server/ authoritative tick + queue/lobby + character screen → 5 humans.
- Phase 5: tuning with Matt playing.

## NEXT STEPS (2026-09-18 night — phase 4 reached)
Playable locally (`npm run dev` → `/client/index.html?key=5&dungeon=hollow-vault&class=warden`) and over the network (`npm run server` + `?net=1`). Main 0b63c85, 668 tests. All run policy lives in `stepRun` (one authority, one call site); servers and clients only call createRun/stepRun.
1. Land fix/run-options-wiring (P0: clause + loadout never reached a run through any host).
2. Then a convergence audit under the repro-not-citation rule; zero verified defects before any release talk.
3. Matt decisions parked: chanter-stance (verse semantics), server-account-store (accounts/auth model for Ash over the wire), BIBLE `[DECIDE]` items (class names, combo numbers, key range/par time, Ascension visibility).
4. Phase 5 is Matt playing: tuning from play, not from tests.
Standing rule: every audit and integration test reproduces through the public path (createRun/stepRun, the bot loop, the server room over ws, the client worker host); a mechanic that is not wired into the composition root in the same PR is a P0, not a note.
